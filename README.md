# ZomatoDataset

Indians love their food and they live to eat. But it is the food-tech unicorn Zomato that revolutionized the way we perceive or even receive our food. Bringing the food to our doorsteps, easing out 'where to dine' worries with the bonus of superb discounts and excellent live tracking features, Zomato turned the food into a business, a profitable one at that with just simple rebranding of a food directory website!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

But it is now going through a hard time crunching these enormous amounts of data that is being produced everyday! As a result of which they have selected you to analyse & come up with elegant data visuals and insights which you can convey to the concerned stakeholders. 

You're given the Zomato dataset for various types of restaurants across regions in Bengaluru. Following attributes are available-
name : contains the name of the restaurant
online_order : whether online ordering is available in the restaurant or not
book_table : table booking option available or not
rate : contains the overall rating of the restaurant out of 5

location : contains the neighborhood in which the restaurant is located
rest_type : restaurant type
cuisines : food styles, separated by comma
approx_cost(for two people) : contains the approximate cost for meal for two people

Objective: 

1. Zomato wants to expand its reach to a couple of more restaurants. Identify the potential regions with top players which can act as a bridge and help zomato to do that.

2. They are also worried about the ratings and want to understand whether they have any impact on the average cost for meal of two people.  
                                                                                                                
3. Figure out which restaurants need an inspection right away! 

Bonus Question: Do zero ratings hold any truth or are they completely false?
